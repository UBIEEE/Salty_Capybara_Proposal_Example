## Milestones

### Milestone Set 1: 11/8/23
Worked on Arduino Ultrasonic sensor. 
Sensor can:
- Detect how far an object is based on where it is.

### Milestone Set 2: 11/22/23
Week 1:  
* Positioning algorithm can properly visualize mouse in simulation. <-- Working on this.
* Notes for next week: Find out what a positioning Algorithm is. 
Week 2:
* 
* Can make the motors spin from the battery. <-- Bro what does this mean because I dont think its what I'm thinking it is...

### Milestone Set 3: 11/29/23
* Microcontroller can control the motors.

* Microcontroller can read sensor data and calculate the position of the mouse.
* Microcontroller can run the algorithm.
* 
  
### Milestone Set 4: Over break
* TBD: Bussin

### Milestone Set 5: 1/10/24
* Mouse can move in a straight line a stop when it reaches an obstacle.
* Mouse can turn 90 degrees when told to by the algorithm.
* Mouse can move for 10 minutes straight. 
* Mouse can execute different algorithms based on user inputs from physical buttons on the mouse. 

### Milestone Set 6: 1/24/24
* Mouse can move through a maze randomly without hitting walls.

### Milestone Set 7: 2/7/24
* Mouse can solve the maze.
